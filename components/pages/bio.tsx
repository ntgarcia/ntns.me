            I'm Nathan, a student at SAIT studying Software Development. Born in
            the Philippines, and raised in Los Angeles before moving to Canada,
            I've always had a passion for the arts. Growing up, I became more
            attentive to great design that enhances experiences around me,
            naturally gravitating to anything forward thinking and innovative.

          <p>
            In my Software Development journey, I grew enamored in UI/UX design
            and graphic design. I knew I wanted to refine these core values into
            product design, where I can combine creative design aesthetics with
            thoughtful and sustainable functionalities. Eager to contribute
            innovative, user-centric solutions, I immerse myself in every stage
            of the design process, from concept to prototyping.

            In my spare time you'll likely find me hitting the gym, gaming,
            DJing, and almost always listening to music (
